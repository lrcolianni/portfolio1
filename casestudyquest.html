      <h2>Problem:</h2>
        <p>Virtual learning is becoming more prominent in the world, but there are not many websites that promote continued learning without school. Students are always complaining that they will not use this in the real world, so their motivation to learn it goes down.</p>
      <h2>Solution:</h2>
        <p>Quest keeps track of everything the students learn on one platform that teachers can use to track skills and grades. Quest uses challenges where teachers connect to the Common Core State Standards and challenge students to find what they are learning in the real world. This also earns them rewards that the teacher or class can create. Teachers can use Quest to keep track of all assignments, making everything virtual.</p>

        <p class="swot">Google classroom, Freckle, and SeeSaw were researched to help gain insight on how to compete. Google classroom and SeeSaw has an interactive dashboard, and assignments can be made. Freckle has specific content practice, but has leveling up features that are motivating to students. The one thing they all had in common was data tracking, and communication with parents. These are essential to compete with educational technology.</p>

        <p class="flowp">Getting into Quest two important use flows were made on how ti sign in and sign up. They need to be very user friendly since children of all ages will be involved and have minimal clicking and scrolling. Kids also need minimal typing so premade buttons are used to help them login faster with minimal teacher assistance. Once inside the dashboard, the three main user flows are: how to post and assignment/challenge, how to contact parents, and how to enter an assignment grade. The user flows need to be made twice from the perspective of the teacher and then of the child/parent. </p>

      <h2>Color Palette:</h2>
      <div class="colordesktop">
        <p class="pcolor">Quest is promoting to students mainly children. The color palette needed to appeal to children, be fun vibrant and engaging. We also focused on adventure which is represented by the earth, which is why green and blue are the main colors.</p>
        <img class="color" src="images/questcolors.svg" alt="color palette with teal, navy, black, grey and white">
      </div>
      <h2>Typography</h2>
      <div class="typodesktop">
        <p class="ptypo">The typography also needed to appeal to children but also not take away from the learning or make the user interface confusing. Chango was the most unique and has limited use. Didact Gothic is also unique but is easy to read and is used for headers. Roboto is very easy to read and is used for any large amounts of text.</p>
        <img class="typo" src="images/questtypo.svg" alt="typography font is heebo, muli, and noto sans">
      </div>
      <h2>Wireframes:</h2>
        <p class="pwireframe">The wireframes help set the precedent of what a teachers dashboard will be like, and how that compares to a students view. The teacher allows for more options and more text. The students have more pictures, and limited text on a page. It helped us identify how both users have access to the same content but in different ways. Originally the dashboard and challenges were going to be together on the same page, but it felt too crowded and overwhelming. Especially since there were already so many buttons on the dashboard.</p>
      <div class="wireframedesktop">
        <img class="wireframe" id="w1"src="images/wireframequest.jpg" alt="wireframe of homescreen">
        <img class="wireframe"id="w2" src="images/wireframequest2.jpg" alt="wireframe of dashboard">
      </div>
      <h2>Perference Testing:</h2>
        <p class="ppreference">The dashboard header was tested for color preference. 83% preferred the blue header.</p>
      <div class="preferencedesktop" id="questwireframedesktop">
        <img class="preference" src="images/questpreference1.jpg" alt="colored mock up of the homescreen in white">
        <img class="preference" id="p2" src="images/questpreference2.jpg" alt="colored mock up of the homescreen in navy">
      </div>
      <h2>Usability Testing:</h2>
        <p class="pusability">After user testing it was discovered that was not enough labels, even for the buttons. Teachers were able to identify what they did but struggled and made the experience more difficult. Labels were added to buttons to help identify what they do. Some labels were marked too similar as buttons and users replaced the button all together with the label. The label needed to be made more clear and less button-like. The biggest issue was for the data on the child’s perspective. They did not understand the language, and the content needed to be more kid friendly and color coded.</p>

        <div class="conclusiondesktop">
          <p class="pconclusion">Overall, it was very helpful to do user testing and identify that although teachers need a lot of functions they need to be labeled clearly for them to access them efficiently and quickly. Students responded very well to the colors and how engaging the dashboards looked, but struggled understanding the data which was brought to a kid friendly language. All 3 user groups showed a strong need for a new educational website to create a learning environment that can be accessed inside or outside of the classroom. By combining it with CCSS, teachers can identify lack of skills very quickly and notify parents with the exact assignments that show the data.</p>
