      <h1 class="bio">Work Life</h1>
      <p>I started my career as a teacher, and learned so many valuable skills. I started designing content and fell in love with how design lets me have more control over helping people than teaching. I currently am a User Experience Digital Coordinator at Kearney, designing content for clients.</p>
