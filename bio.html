I started designing content and fell in love with how design lets me have more control over helping people than teaching. I currently am a User Experience Digital Coordinator at Kearney, designing content.</p>

      <p class="paragraphpadding" class="headingleft" class="pwidth">My one passion in life has always been to help others and because of this I always felt that if I wanted to accomplish this I needed to become a teacher. Specifically, a special education teacher. <br /><br /><br />Special education has always been a passion of mine. I have always had a <mark>desire to design,</mark>develop, test and that's what led me to teach education. I taught for four years, and found out that it was not something that I truly loved doing every day, but I truly loved seeing the results. </p>

      <p class="deskptoppadding" class="headingleft" class="pwidth">When hearing the word teacher, you  might think how they can be “creative,”  “problem solvers,” “intuitive,” or even a “designer.” How can they even relate?<br /><br /><br />As a teacher I accomplished many projects that required me to be a designer. <mark>I designed curriculum</mark> for every subject for every single day, modified it for every student, while making it engaging. <mark>I designed data processes, posters, projects, ideas,</mark> concepts that go beyond what we do in the classroom. Every single day I had to ensure that what I was presenting to those students was the best content I could come up with. Which means, I also spent hours gathering data and ensuring that what I was developing was backed by numbers. <br /><br /><br />Unfortunately, the life of a teacher does not allow you to go through the design process as much and in depth as you want, but I learned a lot on how to do it for so many things at once, and how to interpret the data quickly. </p>

      <p class="deskptoppadding" class="headingleft" class="pwidth">My last straw as a teacher was my last year teaching. I was on <mark>two design curriculum committees, designing content</mark> for my district, and I designed for the data collection committee, but I still was not convinced I was a designer (crazy, I know). I had just <mark>designed math content</mark> that was being pushed out to all of the classrooms in my school that day. Math posters, math ideas and concepts to help students learn. After school, several teachers approached me and told me how much my designs helped their students. I realized that me teaching isn’t helping students in the way I wanted. I want to help people in a way where I can <mark>help identify the problem, and lead the outcome.</mark> <br /><br /><br />I am grateful for my experience as a teacher, I learned many skills that I will forever use. One being my communication, and presentation skills. I am also incredibly grateful that I found a career that aligns with my passion of helping people. Now that I have been in the UX field,<mark> I can truly say that I see my designs helping people and it is something that excites me to go to work every day.</mark> </p>
